  "description": "Designing WordPress themes the old-fashioned way is time-consuming and error-prone. Automating the build process allows us to integrate best practices into our workflow while saving time. This project is a *starter kit* for developing highly optimized WordPress themes with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), among other tools. This is *not* meant to be a starter theme or framework (although I have included a *minimum viable theme* to demonstrate some of the possibilities). It is, instead, a kind of *project scaffolding* and *example workflow* for modern and efficient WordPress theme development.",
